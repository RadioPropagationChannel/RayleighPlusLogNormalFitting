# RayleighPlusLogNormalFitting

Here we show how a mobile propagation measurement could be processed. More, in detail information is contained in SuzukiFit_V01.pdf.

We provide an example file (.mat) corresponding to a continuous wave, CW, RF signal assumed to be received under Rayleigh plus lognormal (multipath over shadowing) fading conditions (the so-called Suzuki distribution). 

We present a way of preprocessing the supplied time series and how we can separate out the fast and slow signal vitiations due to multipath and shadowing, respectively. 

We also fit the slow variations expressed in logarithmic units to a Gaussian distribution.  

The supplied data and Matlab scripts and functions are in directory SW.
